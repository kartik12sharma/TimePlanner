## Project Objective

TimePlanner is a web app that helps you plan your time around goals. Add health and academic goals with priority, time slots and date ranges. The app detects scheduling conflicts, suggests resolutions based on priority, and flags unrealistic schedules. It allows to view timetable by week or day — color coded by category. It also provides algorithm planning based on goal-priority for a particular goal over a period of time.
